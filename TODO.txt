Things that need work: (-) TODO (*) DONE

 - ACTIONS
    - Implement a test OEM action for reference

 - DBUS interface:
    - need to hook current Tree into DBUS: allow sending the internal commands
    - hook up signals via plugins

 - GET aggregate plugin support:
    - Need to filter out @meta from Properties
    - Need to load plugins for each property

 - implement for GET:
    $skip
    $top
    $filter
    $expand

 - PUT/PATCH/POST support

 - ETAGS support. Proposal:
    - etags should be stored in the aggregate in the Headers map.
    - Updates to the aggregate trigger update of etags

 - Redfish compliant HTTP ERROR responses
    - some generic boilerplate to do this?
    - Need some generic domain redfish error helpers to handle generating JSON output and http error codes

 - DELETE
    * DELETE Implemented
    - can return GET representation of the deleted object (optional per spec, lets try to do it)
    - Need to return http 405 for undeletable, or when trying to delete a collection

 - CERTIFICATE support:
    * SSL support
    * Automatically generate CA and Server Cert
    - move certs to subdir
    - Add net.InterfaceAddrs() - list of all local IP addresses - to the SAN list
    - Get local hostname and add to SAN list
    - Some sort of notification to regenerate the local SSL certificate if interfaces change?

 - AccountService
    - Interesting case: PAM? getent passwd? Automatically create? How to get privileges? (PAM, too?)
    - Really ought to have strong support for oauth here. (so that redfish never needs to handle the actual password)

 - Chassis

 - Schema support: should aggregate load the metadata/json schema and automatically populate? Should it validate?

 - LINK Header

 - Common redfish resource properties
    - Do we need to do some special handling for the following properties, which are all specified as standard redfish resource properties?
    - Id
    - Name
    - Description
    - Status
    - Links
    - Members
    - RelatedItem
    - Actions
    - Oem

 - Generic TASK Service

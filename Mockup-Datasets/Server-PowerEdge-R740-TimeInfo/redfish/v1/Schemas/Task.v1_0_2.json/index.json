Suspended shall be used to indicate  that the Task is stopped (e.g., by a user), but can be restarted in a seamless manner.  Interrupted shall be used to indicate  that the Task was interrupted (e.g., by a server crash) in the middle of processing, and the user should either re-run/restart the Task.  Pending shall be used to indicate  that the Task has been queued and will be scheduled for processing as soon as resources are available to handle the request.  Stopping shall be used to indicate that the Task is in the process of moving to a Completed, Killed, or Exception state.  Completed shall be used to indicate that the task has completed normally.  Killed shall be used to indicate  that the task has been stopped by a Kill state change request (non-graceful shutdown).  Exception shall be used to indicate  that the Task is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error condition.  Service shall be used to indicate that the Task is in a state that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.  This state is used when a corrective action is possible. "
